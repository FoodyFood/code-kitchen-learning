### Starting The Website

To let our website be seen by the public, we need to serve the website.

We need to do 2 things to get our website serving.

![cd-to-repo](docs/cd-to-repo-dir.PNG)

```bash
cd code-kitchen-learning/
```
Then press enter.

Next we type the following and press enter like before.

```bash
make website
```

Now your website should be getting served to the world.

### Where can I see it

In the following link, replace '/user/foodyfood' with your own username:
https://code-kitchen.foodyfood.cloud/user/foodyfood/proxy/8000

For example, here is one for the user jimbeam:
https://code-kitchen.foodyfood.cloud/user/jimbeam/proxy/8000

### Editing The Website

Double click the file called 'index.html' inside the code-kitchen-learning folder on the left.

In here you will see some text, try changing it, then refresh the tab you opened your link in. 

Congratulations, you just made and edited a website.

Try adding some more paragraphs, try googling ''how to make text bold in a html webpage'' to see how to make things bold.

Try adding this code at the bottom to add a picture:

```html
<img src="https://foodyfood.cloud/images/logo.png" alt="A Yummy Cookie">
```
